## Describe the bug

<!--
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

## Steps to reproduce

A description of how to trigger this bug.

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

If it's possible follow these guidelines for a good sample and I will most likely look at the issue sooner:

- Post a full GitHub repository. Not a zip file, half baked snippet etc. If GitHub is new to you consider it a great learning opportunity and chance to get involved.
- The repository should have just ONE step max for me to get running, and that is "Restore NuGet Packages". If there are any other missing dependencies, or new features I will most likely move on to another issue.
- I'm not trying to be awkward. I'm just busy and I'm helping a lot of people, not just you, so help me out and I will help you out.
